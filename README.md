## Game Overview

Space Invaders II is a C++ project that brings the classic arcade action of Space Invaders to life. The game begins with an intriguing introduction that sets the stage for your epic battle against the alien invaders. You'll navigate through a user-friendly menu that allows you to start the game, adjust the difficulty level, review controls, and exit when needed.

During gameplay, extraterrestrial foes will appear randomly on the screen. You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, armed with lasers to eliminate the invaders. There are different difficulty levels, affecting the speed and aggressiveness of the aliens. Destroying aliens earns you points, with each type of extraterrestrial having a different point value.

Your mission is to eliminate all the aliens before their numbers reach 15; otherwise, you lose the game, forfeiting half of your accumulated points. However, if you manage to destroy all the invaders, you win, and your points are doubled.
